    <h1>Stop Global Geoengineering</h1>
    <p><strong>The sky was never theirs to control.</strong><br>
    We are witnessing one of the most dangerous experiments in human history—conducted without consent, cloaked in secrecy, and denied by those responsible.</p>

    <p><strong>Aerosol spraying. Solar radiation management. Stratospheric injection.</strong><br>
    Whatever they choose to call it, the skies tell the truth. Every day, unnatural trails crisscross above us—leaving behind haze, blocking the sun, and disrupting nature itself.</p>

    <p>This is not conspiracy.<br><strong>This is geoengineering.</strong></p>

    <h2>Why We Must Act Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Our health is under threat</li>
      <li>Our climate is being manipulated</li>
      <li>Our freedom to breathe clean air and live in balance is being stolen</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You are not imagining it.<br>You are not alone.</p>

    <h2>Take a Stand</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="#">Learn what’s happening</a> | 
      <a href="#">Take action</a> | 
      <a href="#">Spread the word</a>
    </p>

    <p><em>Together, we will break the silence. This movement begins with you.</em></p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
