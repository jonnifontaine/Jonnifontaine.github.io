Thanks for the screenshot—yep, that clears it up. The issue is simple: your site repo doesn’t yet have any actual **HTML files**, **CSS**, or **JavaScript**—just a placeholder file called `Page` and a `README.md`.

So when you go to your GitHub Pages URL, it doesn’t have anything to render. That’s why you’re not getting a proper website output yet—and why I couldn’t fetch or zip anything meaningful earlier.

### Here's what to do:

1. **Create an `index.html` file** in your repo.
2. Add some basic content, like this:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>Stop Global Geoengineering</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>We are awake. We see the sky.</h1>
     <p>Time to end geoengineering.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. Commit that to your repo.

Once that’s live, your site at [https://jonnifontaine.github.io](https://jonnifontaine.github.io) will start showing a real webpage—and then I can absolutely grab it, zip it, and hand it back.

Want help creating the `index.html` and pushing it to GitHub? I can give you a ready-made file or walk you through it.
